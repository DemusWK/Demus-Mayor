<br></br>
A. The Demus Mayor Service allows Demus Mayor users to retail products and services, supply products and services, send value within users (to top-up stock wallet), submit status text, profile photos and other communications submitted by you, as well as the automatic submission of your “last seen” status (collectively, the “Status Submissions”). These Status Submissions may be hosted, shared, and/or published as part of the Demus Mayor Service, and may be visible to other users of the Service who have your mobile phone number in their mobile phone and which you have not expressly blocked. For clarity, direct transactions, messages, location data and photos or files that you send/transact directly to other Demus Mayor users/3rd party will only be viewable by those user(s) or 3rd party(s) or group(s) you directly transact with/send such information. As clarified in the following section, you retain your ownership rights in your Status Submissions. You understand that whether or not such Status Submissions are published, Demus Mayor does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.
<br></br>
B. You shall be solely responsible for your own Status Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. Because Demus Mayor is only acting as a repository of data, user submitted statuses do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of Demus Mayor, and Demus Mayor makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any status. In connection with Status Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Demus Mayor to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all Status Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the Status Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service. To be clear: you retain all of your ownership rights in your Status Submissions, but you have to have the rights in the first place. However, by submitting the Status Submissions to Demus Mayor, you hereby grant Demus Mayor a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Status Submissions in connection with the Demus Mayor Service and Demus Mayor ‘s (and its successor’s) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Demus Mayor Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each subscriber to your status on the Demus Mayor Service a non-exclusive license to access your Status Submissions through the Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a Status Submission from the Demus Mayor Service. However, Demus Mayor reserves the rights to retain such information for record and record use purposes.
<br></br>
C. In connection with Status Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant Demus Mayor all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Demus Mayor or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another person; (vi) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs; (vii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein; or (viii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.
<br></br>
D. Adult content must be identified as such. Demus Mayor does not endorse any Status Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Demus Mayor expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Status Submissions. Demus Mayor does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights via its Service, and Demus Mayor will remove all content and Status Submissions if properly notified that such content or Status Submission infringes on another’s intellectual property rights and may close the account if seen as required. To file a copyright infringement notification, please send a written communication that includes substantially the following (see Section 512©(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act): (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material, including the mobile phone number of the Demus Mayor user allegedly infringing the copyrighted work; (iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted; (v) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Such takedown notices may be emailed to info@demusmayor.com. Demus Mayor reserves the right to remove content and Status Submissions and close user account without prior notice. Demus Mayor may also terminate a user’s access to the Service, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer, or for any or no reason, including being annoying. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than once and/or has had a Status Submission removed from the Service more than twice. An annoying person is anyone who is (capriciously or not) determined to be annoying by authorized Demus Mayor employees, users, associates or management. Demus Mayor also reserves the right to decide whether content or a Status Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to excessive length or limited interest. Demus Mayor may remove such transactions, status Submissions and/or terminate a User’s access for violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
